- ```Game``` is a collection of players running a set campaign, organised by a single Game master.

# Project specifications
## The Problem
When running a game like Dungeons & Dragons, it can be difficult for the organiser ```(Game master)``` to keep track of the details of all their games.
Each Game master can have multiple players across many campaigns. Players can be in multiple games run by the same Game master. The Game master might even want to track similarities between their games, such as when they started, how long they have lasted, how often they're played or similar content between thier games.

### Why does the problem need solved?
If the Game master's time can be taken away from having to organise their games, then more time can be spent adding more fun content to the games.
Increasing the enjoyment Game master's get from their games can also reflect on the player's experience, helping them enjoy their time playing more.
Fun is the whole point, after all.

### How will this be achieved?
The idea is to automate most of the boring parts of organisation.
The Game master should be able to;
- Create new games, campaigns and players.
- Assign players to each game, making sure that player details are consistent across games.
- Assign a campaign to each game, making sure that campaign details are consistent across games.
- Track details of individual games.
- Keep personal notes on individual games.
- Track statistics of all games, campaigns and players.
